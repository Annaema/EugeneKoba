### Hi, I'm Eugene 👋🏾

![IMG_4929_01](https://github.com/EugeneKoba/EugeneKoba/assets/120111293/615946c7-a1b4-4b0e-a988-48ad8e63a344)

I'm a Developer & Analyst who is passionate about Insurance, Data & Tech! I aim to create technology to elevate people, and build a community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Javascript, SQL & more. I have recently completed a 'Car Insurance & Rental' website that gives users an estimated Car Insurance Quote at the click of a button, plus much more! I am currently working on a Finance Landing Page with Typescript & Bootstrap! My interest in the React Ecosystem led me to join the [React Developers](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6519652/) group on Linkedin, take part in Hackathons and attend talks with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)!
